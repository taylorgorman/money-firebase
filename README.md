## To Do
1. Change favicon
1. Get functions working in emulator - `yarn install`
1. Write a function (or wait until I need one to do this)
1. How do I want/need to use the hosting emulator?
1. Write firestore rules such that users can only see their own data
1. Start throwing up some functionality! No real styles yet, just make it work.

1. Used react-firebase-hooks and YouTube video (Resources.1) to finish basic auth in like 10 minutes!
1. Used react-firebase-hooks and YouTube video (Resources.1) to setup basic database read/write.
1. Set up emulators for local dev. That was super quick.
